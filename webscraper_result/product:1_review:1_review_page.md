#####  _1.0 out of 5 stars_ Looting innocent customers, fraudsters and pathetic service from Amazon and samsung ⟨109⟩
Reviewed in India on 22 July 2025
Colour: Orange Haze __Size: 8GB + 128GB⟨110⟩ __Verified Purchase⟨101⟩
I purchased the Samsung M36 5G on 16 July 2025 from Amazon, and within just a few days, the display stopped working completely.  
  
I immediately reached out to Amazon for a replacement, but to my surprise, they refused to provide any support or replacement, even though the issue occurred well within the return period.  
  
I then visited the Samsung Service Centre, hoping for a resolution — but the experience was even worse. The staff was unhelpful, and no proper service or repair was provided. I’ve wasted hours with no result.  
  
I feel completely let down by both Samsung and Amazon. This was a high-value product, and I expected at least basic after-sales service. Unfortunately, this has turned into a frustrating and disappointing experience.  
  
I strongly advise others to think twice before buying this phone or trusting the service support from either Samsung or Amazon.  
मैंने 16 जुलाई 2025 को Amazon से Samsung M36 5G खरीदा था, लेकिन कुछ ही दिनों में इसका डिस्प्ले पूरी तरह से बंद हो गया।  
  
मैंने तुरंत Amazon से संपर्क किया और फोन की रिप्लेसमेंट मांगी, लेकिन उन्होंने साफ मना कर दिया और कोई सहायता नहीं दी, जबकि ये समस्या रिटर्न पीरियड के अंदर ही हुई थी।  
  
इसके बाद मैंने Samsung सर्विस सेंटर का रुख किया, लेकिन वहाँ का अनुभव और भी खराब रहा। स्टाफ का व्यवहार बेहद लापरवाह था और कोई संतोषजनक सेवा नहीं दी गई। मैंने कई घंटे बर्बाद किए लेकिन कोई समाधान नहीं मिला।  
  
Samsung और Amazon — दोनों ने पूरी तरह से निराश किया है। यह एक महँगा फोन था और मुझे कम से कम अच्छी आफ्टर-सेल्स सर्विस की उम्मीद थी, जो बिल्कुल नहीं मिली।  
  
मैं अन्य ग्राहकों से अनुरोध करता हूँ कि इस फोन को खरीदने से पहले ज़रूर सोचें, और Samsung या Amazon की सेवा पर आँख बंद करके भरोसा ना करें।

Colour: Serene Green __Size: 6GB + 128GB⟨113⟩ __Verified Purchase⟨101⟩
Don't think too much!  
Except the missing part of punch hole, the phone is actually good. I got it at 16k from Amazon. Considering the price point, it is awesome. I'll update after a few days of use. But I must say, the build quality is brilliant. It looks very premium and battery lasts pretty good. Out of the box it had 64% and after 5-6 hours of continual use, it is still standing strong at 14%. I think that's pretty handy. It will surely last a day. The camera quality is quite good also. As of now, I haven't seen any bad issue with it. Maybe not a huge upgrade from M35 physically but considering the software development, that's also a good point. It is very smooth and didn't experience any heating issue, except after that first boot, which is quite natural for any phone. Go for it! Don't worry.

#####  _3.0 out of 5 stars_ Antenna power is very poor ⟨121⟩
Reviewed in India on 16 July 2025
Colour: Orange Haze __Size: 6GB + 128GB⟨122⟩ __Verified Purchase⟨101⟩
The mobile is good but the antenna is poor and there is a reason to say that.  
The reason is i was using honor Y9 Prime 2019 when I compare the Samsung galaxy m36 5g to the honor the antenna power of honor is much better as it use to pull 3g inside the house atheist 1 bar and 2g 4 Larsson I thought buying this phone will improve the signal but to my surprise the new Samsung phone can't pull the 2g signal leave about 3g and further 4g and don't dream about 5g .  
So if any one thinking to buy this phone for better signal power if facing network problem, don't buy as the technology has not improve from 2019 to 2025 it has become worse.  
So this mobile has become my computer as I can't call from the mobile. The company should improve their signal power. Hope they take a note of this.

Ordered this for my mom. The usage is typically 1-2 hours of network / whatsapp calls with family involves voice & video calls per day. Maybe 1-2 hours of video content viewing over WiFi & data. Overall 5hours of screen on time per day. The phone does get a bit hot after 1 hours of video calls which i guess is ok at this price point. I observed some app crashes like while making some UPI payments, when it tries to open camera module to scan QR codes, strange. However, its less than a week of observations, probably some software updates could fix some issues. Hoping for the hardware to last 6+ years like the software updates. Camera is decent. Sound over speaker is loud and gets the job done. Do not expect gaming. Battery life so far seems decent with the usage level, lasts a day with 5-6 hours screen on time with 30-40% left by end of the day. For the price you could get other options, but my need is for longer software updates and that's the only selling point. Otherwise a 3-4 star phone in terms of value for money.

Product is good in quality but few disadvantages like if you use SD card then only one sim can be used since they provide only 2 slots and there is no separate slot for SD card and no charger included as well no slot for headphone jack so you can only use airpods and cannot use wired earphones
