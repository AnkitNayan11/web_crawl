#####  _1.0 out of 5 stars_ Camera, hanging, worst, good in hand feel, good looking ⟨102⟩
Reviewed in India on 12 June 2025
Verified Purchase⟨100⟩
On paper the product is good but in real it doesn't not fullfill the requirements as specified camera is worst, having a phone but we can't click a photo,the camera app automatically closes if you click photo and photo are also not saved in gallery. After many attempts of the photo is clicked than the picture quality is very poor, it provides photos as jio phone or any other 2mp camera phone.  
Phone is hanging alot in 1 week use as it seems it has been used for many years.  
I requested for replacement a technician was alloted and he said replacement will be done but it has been 5 days but I am receiving any response.  
The worst experience I have been using this phone.  
It only looks good,in hand it feels good but from inside it is worst why companies make such worst phone I don't understand.  
The Acer has broken my trust, it could not do better in mobile industry.

Reviewed in India on 30 June 2025
Colour: Cosmic Green __Size: 6GB+128GB⟨99⟩ __Verified Purchase⟨100⟩
It's works just as they advertised it.  
  
THE DISPLAY is really good, the colour and viewing angles are astonishing.  
  
THE SOUND is crisp it's not too loud, it's on the comforting side but it is very crisp.  
  
THE PERFORMANCE is very good at this price point, it's a gaming phone you have to keep that in mind it's an all-around balanced phone that checks all the boxes ... in that sense day to usage the performance is really good, and heating is not a issue an issue device does work very well. however you can absolutely do light gaming on it ... performance is very stable and it doesn't throttle at all .  
  
THE CAMERA is good it takes sharp and detailed images in good conditions and even in low lights the shots are decent ... The colour science on all the 3 cameras (including the macro lens) is very consistent. Shots taken are good, portrait mode has decent edge detection. Pictures are vivid and punchy coloured (as expected from Acer tuning)... Selfie are crisp too skin is almost perfect as the vivids the tones a bit .  
  
THE BATTERY is big changes grade, you can't kill the phone even if you use it all day ... even on heavy usage the phone lasted about a bit short of 1.5 days for me. The charging is at 33w and they even provide a charger not like other brands thinking removing charger will save alot of money.  
  
THE BUILD is really good , yes it is plastic frame with acrylic back but it's sturdy af ... front is panda glass, Great at this price segment, it has tougher Crack resistance, but it can scratch.  
  
Overall, the experience is reallllly good for the price I paid for it (₹11999 for 8 ,128GB variant) I will highly recommend this if you want an all-around balanced phone.

Reviewed in India on 9 July 2025
Verified Purchase⟨100⟩
Good camera with Ai functions, good and smooth display, Excellent fast charging, Battery performance average to good, no heating while normal gaming and charging,  
Smooth overall performance.  
  
Cons :  
Missing some essential UI interface.  
Split screen options, status bar missing some apps activity and notifications,  
Little bit UI improvements required compared to other brands. Someone Little bit concern with weight and size.  
  
Overall Good phone in budget segments upto 15k. Acer trying to give more to Customers in this price.  
  
Hope upcoming updates resolve the above issues

last week my husband order this phn for me. Honestly at that tym we have no idea how it would be coz it's new in market and we were looking for the budget friendly phone. When we got this we were extremely surprised. It is so amazing. Everything in this phone is superb. Apps open quickly, multitasking is smooth. When I use it I wondered battery life is also good. I used it all day but the battery was still good enough for the night. Also it looks expensive. it Doesn't look like bulky or cheap at all. It's Screen and colours are amazing. Screen is running very smooth.Best part is the camera which I was personally looking for. I have shared some photos from it as u can see. Sound is also impressive. I really appreciate acer for this👏. If you are looking for budget friendly phone then I personally recommend this. You should really go for this without any hesitation and confusion.

Putting a review after using this device for a month.the camera is fine enough but the OS is not at all good.when you open 2-3 apps at one go then the apps will work fine for some time but if u minimize them and try to open them again then the android will not respond at finally the device will get restarted.overall its not a multitasking device as i face OS freezing and restart problem frequently.its frustating if u have extended RAM but still the processor gets freezed while in use.not recommending it to buy.

Reviewed in India on 27 June 2025
Colour: Carbon Black __Size: 6GB+128GB⟨123⟩ __Verified Purchase⟨100⟩
I wasn't sure if I had made a good purchase with this phone as I've always bought stock Android phones with good battery life since I use my phone as a utility device for work and communication primarily, however I was very pleasantly surprised, and I love the phone.  
  
Here are my observations -  
1. It's stock Android without any bloatware.  
2. If your data is backed up on Google, it syncs and downloads smoothly.  
3. Once set up, it gives instant response to app usage, including banking and finance apps, Amazon, ticket booking apps, etc. My phone use now saves me so much time because of the fast response.  
4. The charger adapter is just over 20W so perfect for Type C fast charging, and the cable is heavy duty braided. Fast charging time, and I'm getting about a day and a half with normal use, and there's usually around 30% left at the end of a day of a lot of use. Of course, the phone is new, and I'm sure this will change as it gets older.  
5. The 65 MP camera features both various auto as well as manual modes, and while I'm not fussy about photos, I'm very happy with the landscape and skyscape photos I've taken at different times of the day, including in the evening. I haven't yet tried night photos.  
6. There are several utility features like a compass, which I actually use.  
7. The keyboard software is intuitive and responds well to sweep typing which I extensively use.  
8. Some Android features like YouTube Music, Google One, etc. you can uninstall if you don't need them and want to save space.  
9. The gel phone case works fine for me and fits well like for any stock Android phone.  
10. Since I only use a bluetooth speaker or headphones, the sounds and volume controls have been fine for me.  
11. Note - the fingerprint sensor is on the side - right side, third button down, but if you include for both hands, it actually works easier if you use your free hand for fingerprint unlocking, so I prefer this to the back-located sensor.  
12. The phone is dual SIM, but note that SIM1 is nano, but SIM2 is micro, so you want to make sure you keep your SIM adapters.  
13. Storage - this was really the only negative - with so many good features, it was rather odd that SIM2 slot is also the storage slot, but only for TF cards, not micro SD cards. Since these are not interchangeable, you have to invest in a TF card which is old school compared to SD cards, and it also means you can't use two SIMs and a storage card. Since I will be using two SIMs in the future, I just have to make sure that I'm not using my phone as a basic storage unit and backing up my data esp photos and videos on the cloud. I prefer a fast response to storing a lot of media. So, I prefer to create things for social media on my computer and transfer via cloud so I can use it on my phone.  
14. Weightwise, the phone is about 200g, so about an average Nokia weight. I've already dropped it twice by mistake, and am relieved to find it continues fine, but it's much better to be careful with the phone.  
15. Screen visuality is good, and since I use backed up display and phone settings which I downloaded to my phone, the phone looks exactly like how I want it to. That's up to you to configure - the phone has great wallpapers, themes, and a very wide range of ring and notification tones, so you can discard what you don't want.  
  
I think it's been the best phone buy I've made till now, and I usually never say I love my phone - I'm saying it now, and I'm very happy with the value for money I've received. If your use and style is similar to mine, you may really enjoy the phone.

#####  _4.0 out of 5 stars_ Fast , clean UI and feature loaded ⟨125⟩

The Acer's newly launched model is no less than it's peers. I have been using this for a month or so and it stacked up great. Definitely recommend.  
Pros and Cons  
- Clean bloatware free UI, makes the phone fast and switching between apps is of no issue. Did not hang once.  
- Crisp Call quality with loud speakers.  
- Back Camera is Good but front camera is average and below par in low light.  
- Display quality of 120Hz is fine, but didn't use much in 120Hz though. 60Hz is fine for everyday usage.  
- Battery lasts for 1 and half day with moderate usage and 1 day with heavy.  
- Charging time is 45 mins from 15% to 85%, which is a bit slow.  
- Useful pre loaded gestures from Acer.  
- No heating issues as of now.  
- The phone feels a bit heavy.  
Overall great phone given the budget and its competitors.

Giving review after 2 months the performance of this mobile is good it is ok for daily usage and for occasional gamers you can play games with low graphics settings and one this is just awesome that was battery backup that was great and when comes to camera which is very poor quality overall the mobile is worth and value for this price when compared to other brand in this segment.
