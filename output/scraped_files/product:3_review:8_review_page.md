Best if you get this in 13499 and go for Samsung original charger cost around 1000 it charge phone in very less time as compared to any normal charger and best cover is spign essential kit you'll get it for 599 something or only spign sand blast cover cost 700  
CONCLUSION:- I AM SURE YOU HAVE WATCHED REVIEW OF THIS PHONE DONT THINK MUCH PURCHASE IF GETTING FOR 13500 BECAUSE ACCESORIES WILL MAKE WHOLE FIGURE 15000 OR MORE SOMETIME HOPE IT HELP

Colour: Moonlight Blue __Size: 8GB + 128GB⟨105⟩ __Verified Purchase⟨100⟩
Good phone but take care to buy the right accessories if you want 3.5 audio jack. Since samsung type c to 3.5 jack not available the next best accessory is to buy apple type c to 3.5 jack if you want to use for audio input.. though volume becomes bit less. Other jacks like sounce with dac gives good audio output but fails if you want for audio input. Also had to purchase 25 watt samsung adapter adding 2000 overall for these two accessories.  
  
Performance and battery ok. Quite big to hold in palm.

#####  _5.0 out of 5 stars_ BEST phone under 15K ⟨113⟩
Reviewed in India on 18 October 2024
Colour: Moonlight Blue __Size: 6GB + 128GB⟨114⟩ __Verified Purchase⟨100⟩
Bought this phone for Rs 13749 in the Great Indian Sale.  
Package does not include a charger, so keep that in mind.  
>>DESIGN: 7/10  
Nothing special, typical samsung design with 3 vertically stacked cameras.  
Display bezels are a bit thicker than the competition but they are uniform on all sides.  
Plastic back does not look good, no matter which color you choose, but a back cover solves that problem.  
>>DISPLAY : 10/10  
The best part about this device is the display, 1080p super amoled with punchy colors and great viewing angles. Samsung finally moved on from outdated U shaped notches and brought a punch hole.  
If you like viewing content then you are in for a treat. Display quality is comparable to what other brands offer in a segment above.  
>>SOUND: 9/10  
Dual speakers with dolby sound, ideal for media consumption. Upper speaker has a bit less volume compared to the bottom one, still it gives a good stereo effect.  
Sound is crisp, loud and clear.  
>>SOFTWARE : 10/10  
Another great aspect of this device. Well designed one ui with tons of features and device level optimizations. Bloatware is present, but can be uninstalled easily.  
Software support is just unbeatable : 4 major os updates and 5 years of security patches.  
One thing to note that goodlock is not available, but a lot of 3rd party workarounds are available.  
>>PERFORMANCE : 8/10  
Surprise, surprise. A well performing phone budget phone from samsung, isn't it great? Antutu scores are above 600k and real life performance is also good. I'm not a gamer , for me the performance is more than enough. no lags , no stutters and no app crashes.  
Phone doesn't heat up in normal usage and video calls, can't tell about gaming, coz I'm not a gamer.  
>>CAMERA : 9.5/10  
One of the best set of cameras available on any budget phone. PERIOD.  
50 MP main camera has OIS and clicks great photos with typical samsung colors and great details.  
8 MP ultrawide is good for occasional photography and making wide angle videos. Wish it was 13MP.  
2 MP macro is useless as always. Just don't know why manufacturers give it.  
13 MP Selfie camera is good, produces social media ready pictures.  
4k video capture is supported from both front and back cameras & you can also switch in between wide and normal lenses just like Iphones. OIS is not available in videos, but the EIS works well.  
>>BATTERY : 9/10  
Battery life is great, gives a screen on time of 8-9 hours on a single charge. Will easily last 2 days on medium usage and 1 full day on heavy usage. Charging is slow, even with the 25 watt charger that samsung sells for Rs 999, it takes 1.5 hrs to charge fully. I'm getting 2 days backup with 5g turned on all the time and about an hour of video calls and some social media.  
>>VERDICT:  
Finally a great budget phone from Samsung that actually peforms well. Camera is great, display is beautiful, speakers are good , battery life is descent and software support is unmatched. Plus the brand value of samsung and knox safety along with it make this a great deal for people who do not game a lot.  
For gamers please choose some other device.

#####  _4.0 out of 5 stars_ Samsung being SAMSUNG! ⟨122⟩
Reviewed in India on 12 April 2025
Colour: Moonlight Blue __Size: 6GB + 128GB⟨114⟩ __Verified Purchase⟨100⟩
I wanted a new with amoled display. At first i went for poco f4 at a great deal but got delivered re pack edition so returned the product. So when I went re order again price went too high. So I was searching for new deal at budget category and found this champ at 13999. I felt everything happens for a reason. I really loved this phone. Battery life, standby, display, speed everything is fabulous. Only con is charging speed. It only supports samsung adapter which is not available in the box. By third party chagers or other brands, charging speed is extremely low. It takes around 3 hours to fully charge. With this kind of battery life and software support. This monster can last for years. If it comes under 15k with offers you can definitely go without any second thought. Above 15k, a bit judgable.
