Bought it as soon as launched. Good phone on budget. Could have been better but given the price, company decided.. 'itne paise main itnaich milega'. Good camera. Is the only good thing i can think about. Case is plastic make Light weight, phone hangs a lot even with 8GB RAM + 128GB Storage. Cant play music loud the phone vibrates. Could have provided a bavk covwr with the phone which would be helpful, one' s i ordered doesn't have the precision cuts for the buttons.

I took this phone on 14th July and I noticed that after 2 to 3 days the battery is draining too fast like it is working only for 1 day and this phone heats a lot. Overall this phone is good quality and has nice features. Samsung should improve the battery quality of this phone so that it will lasts for 2 days maximum.

The phone specs are good but its over priced. The back panel is vibrting to the sound coming from speaker. And the performance is good. Overall a decent phone if you are looking for budget but its not worth of 18,000 recommend if <= 16,000 in sale

Downgrade from m35. I have both m35 and m36  
  
Based on the usage this phone has smaller battery 5000 vs 6000 in m35, one speaker vs stereo in m35, tear drop display vs punch hole in m35  
  
Only upgrade is this one slimmer and looks better than m35.

#####  _5.0 out of 5 stars_ Good phone in this price range ⟨127⟩
Reviewed in India on 18 July 2025
Colour: Orange Haze __Size: 6GB + 128GB⟨99⟩ __Verified Purchase⟨100⟩
Good phone overall for 17.5K -  
Display 3.5/5 (Not as vivid as my old nokia with puredisplay and that one was an lcd)  
Speed/Processor 4/5  
Battery 4/5  
Software 3.5/5 (Too many unecessary Samsung apps - bloatware ? However the One UI depth is impressive and you get Samsung updates for many years).  
Design 3.5 or maybe 4/5 Plastic back, ordinary design.  
Camera 4/5  
Price 4/5  
Will i buy again ? Yes. At this price range there maybe be better configurations. But Samsung has a strong support and a mature ecosystem. I hope they reduce bloatware...they dont need it to sell their devices. A clean install with minimum Samsung apps will be so good.
