__How are ratings calculated?⟨69⟩)
To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyses reviews to verify trustworthiness.

Reviewed in India on 25 May 2025
Isn’t even worth 1 star, very bad quality, hinge opened in 4 days of use. Please don’t buy vivobook. Performances issues, excessive fan noise, even after 5200mha of fan speed laptop wouldn’t go below 87 degrees in task like video editing, heat level excessive. Batter life is worst 1.5 hours for this ‘profession’ laptop is not worth your money, better go for HP or TUF(better quality and performance). Display reflective, fingerprint marks on the screen or back side over the body and it’s not worth even 20K. Graphics card is not even as to what they have written to be. I hope you all don’t make the mistake I’ve made.

Worst laptop of my life and the worst decision. That laptop was delivered to me on 17 march 2025 and within 7 days from delivery i was able to hear a whistling noise when i turned on fans at 100% .  
And it even vibrated at a point. Display is also not that bright. Only one fan creates does not allow good heat dissipation the hinges of the laptop are falling apart and the side panel of the display is coming out as i open the laptop. Company is also worst i called the technician and they came with the fan replacement and told me to not use the fan at 100% i mean why not i paid full price also as summer days are coming what am i supposed to do just let my hands become toast on the laptop also check out the video of whistling and vibration and the picture of screen border
