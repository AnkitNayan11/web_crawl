#####  _5.0 out of 5 stars_ Great phone, best in the price range. No Issues at all. ⟨98⟩

Colour: Moonlight Blue __Size: 8GB + 128GB⟨99⟩ __Verified Purchase⟨100⟩
One of the best phones in the m series. It is very smooth, display quality is excellent. It functions perfectly and is suitable for everyone. It has multiple new features and is the best in this price range. Definitely a must buy if you are looking for a phone below 20000. The packaging was alright, no charger provided, and no headphone jack. Huge display size as mentioned and the phone doesnt hang at all. Its been around 3 months since i purchased it and it has not had an issue. Very Good Smartphone. It also has a sidebar feature which is not available in most mobile phones.

#####  _4.0 out of 5 stars_ Value for money but Fast Charging not working. ⟨102⟩
Reviewed in India on 28 May 2025
Colour: Moonlight Blue __Size: 6GB + 128GB⟨103⟩ __Verified Purchase⟨100⟩
This is a very good phone at this price point. It performed as I expected. The connectivity through phone, wifi and Bt was good. The display was excellent. So was the sound. The camera came up to expectations. It is bulky may be due to the large battery. But that was not compensated by charging and battery life. My only peeve is about Fast Charging. On plugging on to the charger, it displays ‘Fast Charging’ but within seconds it shows only ‘charging’. I have used the same charger and cord for my older Samsung which shows Fast Charging. I tried various combinations of settings for Battery and Charging but they were of no use.  
I took it to the Samsung Showroom. The lady there tried everything and finally said that the disappearing ‘Fast charging ‘ display is a feature in the current series of phones. But Fast charging is happening in the background. I was unconvinced. At about 50% charge it shows I hour 18 minutes for full charge.  
I hope Samsung addresses this problem.  
I am hoping that with the Android upgrade next month this issue may be solved.

Concluding my review on basis of approx 10 days usage.  
Over all this phone is monster. I hve purchased at 14.5k all discount and offers. If u see any discount buy it. (Recommended 8gb and 128gb or 256gb as per ur requirement)  
  
Display - very much good amoled display but don't hve fingerprint in display... But side Mount is fingerprint is functioning very good.  
  
Battery - 6000mah is very good and decent. Give me approx more than 30-40hrs backup. In normal usage (no gaming at all) and it can also last more.  
  
Charging - charging speed is quite good, while charging it get a bit heat but it also controls too fast. U hve to also buy 25watt charger of rupees 999.  
  
UI - the most clean and best ui amoung all android smart phones. Very smooth and user friendly. No hang.  
  
Camera - 50mp decent camera setup... At least better than others brand. Detailing is good enough. Not too good not too bad. In this price point good.  
  
Overall very Good. Trust in samsung.

Colour: DayBreak Blue __Size: 8GB + 128GB⟨112⟩ __Verified Purchase⟨100⟩
It's works just as they advertised it .  
  
THE DISPLAY is really good , after all it's a SAMSUNG OLED panel , the colour and viewing angles are astonishing .  
  
THE SOUND is crisp it's not too loud , it's on the comforting side but it is very crisp and it has DOLBY ATMOS support for compatible songs and videos too .  
  
THE PERFORMANCE is very good at this price point , it's not a gaming phone you have to keep that in mind it's an all-around balanced phone that checks all the boxes ... in that sense day to usage the performance is really good and heating isn't an issue the vapour chamber does work well . It keeps the phone cool , however you can absolutely do light gaming on it ... performance is very stable and it doesn't throttle at all .  
  
THE CAMERA is good it takes sharp and detailed images in good conditions and even in low lights the shots are decent ... The colour science on all the 3 cameras (excluding the macro lens) is very consistent . Shots taken are good , portrait mode has decent edge detection . Pictures are vivid and punchy coloured (as expected from SAMSUNG tuning)... Selfie are crisp too skin is almost perfect as the vivids the tones a bit .  
  
THE BATTERY is big changes grade , you can't kill the phone even if you use it all day ... even on heavy usage the phone lasted about a bit short of 1.5 days for me . The charging is capped to 25w but you have to buy the charger separately... but charging speed is fine . No complains on that .  
  
THE BUILD is really good , yes it is plastic frame with acrylic back but it's sturdy af ... front is Corning's Victus+ that's the same on from my Galaxy S22 , it has tougher Crack resistance but it can scratch , so I recommend using a protector film or glass .  
  
Overall the experience is reallllly good for the price I paid for it (₹18499 for 8 ,128GB variant) I will highly recommend this if you want an all-around balanced phone .

#####  _3.0 out of 5 stars_ Decent phone with strong battery, but too bulky for daily comfort ⟨116⟩
Reviewed in India on 18 May 2025
Colour: DayBreak Blue __Size: 6GB + 128GB⟨107⟩ __Verified Purchase⟨100⟩
I bought this phone for my wife mainly because of its solid specs and large battery. While it performs well overall, there are a few things buyers should know before purchasing:  
  
✅ Pros:  
  
The 6000mAh battery is excellent – lasts easily more than a day with moderate usage.  
  
The screen quality is good for watching videos and using apps.  
  
Decent performance for daily tasks like calls, WhatsApp, YouTube, etc.  
  
⚠️ Cons:  
  
The phone is noticeably bulky and heavy. It feels tiring to hold in one hand for long, especially for users with smaller hands.  
  
Not ideal for someone looking for a lightweight or sleek design.  
  
Camera is average – not bad, but not exceptional in low light.  
  
📌 Bottom Line:  
If battery life is your top priority, this phone delivers. But if weight, comfort, and long one-handed use matter to you (or the person you're buying it for), you might want to look for a more compact alternative. I gave it 3 stars mainly due to the form factor and weight – performance-wise, it’s good for the price.

#####  _4.0 out of 5 stars_ Recommended! ⟨118⟩

Colour: Thunder Grey __Size: 6GB + 128GB⟨119⟩ __Verified Purchase⟨100⟩
Here is my honest review after 1 week of usage.  
Pros-  
Exceptional camera, exceptional display quality, appealing build quality( slipped from 1m height without case and tempered glass and literally not even a scratch) and definately one of the best ui experience with one ui.  
Cons-  
The weight is on the heavy side, really heavy side with 222g!  
The performance is not up to the mark and the samsung's Exynos really heats up even while day to day tasks.  
Overall it looks and feels premium but side mounted fingerprint fades the show and with this amoled panel , a display mounted fingerprint could be offered.  
Glitches -  
I don't know it is due to the tempered glass or the something else , but it sometimes skips the touch. Like sometimes scrolling through gallery it's touch just skip for a couple of seconds.  
  
That's the only glitch i noticed but overall the smartphone is Totally worthy and justify it's price!

#####  _4.0 out of 5 stars_ One of the best in the segment from Samsung ⟨123⟩
Reviewed in India on 3 August 2024
Colour: Moonlight Blue __Size: 8GB + 128GB⟨99⟩ __Verified Purchase⟨100⟩
Pros:  
- Great battery backup. With moderate usage on WiFi, can easily last upto 2 days. Also, there is very less battery drain when idle, especially overnight. Definitely one of the best with 6000 mAh. One of my primary reasons to buy this phone.  
- Camera quality at this price is way above average.  
- Finally, punch hole display from Samsung for M series and at this price point.  
- One UI software is very stable and comes with plenty of customisations.  
- No issues in performance with multitasking involving streaming videos, music, social media apps, browser surfing, etc. Can't say about gaming as I am not a gamer.  
- Up to 4 gens of software updates which hardly any company provides even with flagship phones. But need to keep in mind that the product page on Samsung's website clearly states that this is not a promise but just their current plans, and it can be changed anytime at their own discretion.  
  
Cons:  
- Bulky (which is expected considering the massive battery), holding with one hand for extended period of time causes discomfort, specially if you are used to phones weighing below 175g.  
- Headphone jack missing. Considering the thickness of the phone, this could easily have been accommodated.  
- Phone does not come with any IP rating which is surprising, so any contact with water might potentially cause damage.  
- There is a noticeable battery drain with 5G network, but could be improved in future software updates.  
- Not specific to this phone but with all Samsung phones: Missing charging adaptor, back cover, and screen protector. So, need to shell out extra money for these.

#####  _4.0 out of 5 stars_ Power-Packed Mid-Range Contender ⟨125⟩
Reviewed in India on 20 February 2025
Colour: Moonlight Blue __Size: 8GB + 128GB⟨99⟩ __Verified Purchase⟨100⟩
Samsung’s Galaxy M series has been known for offering great value, and the Galaxy M35 5G continues this tradition with a solid mix of performance, battery life, and display quality. But does it truly stand out in the crowded mid-range segment? Let’s dive in.  
  
Design & Display  
  
Samsung keeps things simple yet stylish with the M35. The device features a matte-finish back, giving it a premium feel without being a fingerprint magnet. Available in Dark Blue, Light Blue, and Grey, the color choices are subtle but classy.  
  
The 6.6-inch FHD+ Super AMOLED display is one of the highlights here. With a 120Hz refresh rate, scrolling and animations feel buttery smooth. Peak brightness of 1,000 nits ensures excellent outdoor visibility, and Gorilla Glass Victus+ provides added protection.  
  
Performance & Software  
  
Under the hood, the Galaxy M35 5G is powered by Samsung’s Exynos 1380 processor, a capable mid-range chipset that balances efficiency and power. Paired with 8GB RAM and up to 256GB storage, the phone handles daily multitasking effortlessly.  
  
Gaming performance is decent, with Call of Duty: Mobile and BGMI running smoothly on medium to high settings. However, at this price, Snapdragon-powered alternatives might offer better GPU performance.  
  
On the software front, Samsung’s One UI 6.1 (based on Android 14) delivers a polished experience with useful customization options. Samsung’s 4 years of OS updates and 5 years of security patches ensure longevity, making it a great future-proof device.  
  
Camera Performance  
  
The 50MP primary sensor with OIS is a strong performer, delivering sharp images with good dynamic range. Night photography is decent, though Samsung’s processing sometimes over-brightens low-light shots.  
  
The 8MP ultra-wide camera is functional but struggles with details in low light. The 2MP macro lens, as expected, is more of a filler.  
  
On the front, the 13MP selfie camera takes natural-looking shots with good skin tones. Video recording tops out at 4K 30fps, which is a plus in this price segment.  
  
Battery & Charging  
  
The 6,000mAh battery is a beast, easily lasting 1.5 to 2 days on moderate use. Even with heavy gaming and media consumption, the phone comfortably makes it through a full day.  
  
The only downside? 25W fast charging feels slow compared to rivals offering 65W or more. Expect a full charge in around 90 minutes.  
  
Additional Features  
  
Stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos – Great for watching content.  
  
Knox Security & Knox Vault – Added protection for sensitive data.  
  
No headphone jack – Wireless users won’t mind, but wired audio fans will.  
  
Verdict – Should You Buy It?  
  
The Samsung Galaxy M35 5G is a solid choice for those who prioritize battery life, a high-quality display, and long-term software support. While gaming performance isn’t its strongest suit, the overall package makes it a reliable daily driver.  
  
Pros:  
✔️ Gorgeous 120Hz AMOLED display  
✔️ Massive 6,000mAh battery  
✔️ 4 years of Android updates  
✔️ Good primary 50MP camera with OIS  
  
Cons:  
❌ Charging speed could be better  
❌ No headphone jack  
❌ Ultra-wide and macro cameras are average  
  
Final Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4.2/5)  
  
If you’re looking for a durable, feature-packed Samsung phone with excellent battery life, the Galaxy M35 5G is a great buy under ₹20,000
