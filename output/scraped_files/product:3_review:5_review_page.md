#####  _4.0 out of 5 stars_ It was a good decision from an M31 user. ⟨102⟩
Reviewed in India on 19 May 2025
Colour: DayBreak Blue __Size: 8GB + 128GB⟨103⟩ __Verified Purchase⟨100⟩
I brought the 8GB RAM, 128GB space one. Camera is better than the M31 which I had. While M31 boasts of 64MP, hard to believe that this one which has 50MP has a better camera quality, including night camera. I have used one SIM and one SD card of 512GB which works perfectly fine. So far it didn't hang on me. Battery life is good. Same as the M31 with 6000mah.  
The phone cover was brought separately. The drawback with this phone, had to buy 24w charger and DAC to 3.5mm jack connector separately as these weren't included. Sometimes it heats up while using social media. Didn't have an issues of the youtube video quality switching from Ultra HD to 480P. I believe this might have to do with the mobile network, as mine was connected to WiFi. Has bluetooth v5.3 more easier to connect with bluetooth devices. It has Gorilla Victus and hope it'll last longer as it boasts. UI is very easy to customize. 5G connectivity in my area is poor, so using 4G and WiFi. Need to test 5G connectivity in another area to see how strong this is.

##### _3.0 out of 5 stars_ Honest Review for Samsung Galaxy M35 Rating: ★★★☆☆ (3/5) ⟨119⟩
Reviewed in India on 7 June 2025
Colour: DayBreak Blue __Size: 6GB + 128GB⟨111⟩ __Verified Purchase⟨100⟩
I’ve been using the Samsung Galaxy M35 recently, and here’s my honest, no-hype review after practical usage:  
  
---  
  
📱 Display – Disappointing for AMOLED  
  
Yes, it has a Super AMOLED display — but the white color looks yellowish and off-tone. Even after tweaking display settings, the screen never looks truly white like a good LCD.  
If you prefer clean, natural whites — this screen may leave you disappointed.  
  
---  
  
📶 5G Signal – Not Reliable  
  
Despite being a 5G phone, the signal strength is weak. I noticed frequent network drops and slower speeds, even with a good 5G SIM in a strong coverage area. This is unacceptable in this price range.  
  
---  
  
🔥 Performance & Heating  
  
The phone feels slightly sluggish during scrolling or switching apps. It doesn’t feel as smooth as you’d expect from a device in this segment.  
Also, the phone tends to heat up quickly, even with medium use like downloading apps or light multitasking.  
  
---  
  
🔊 Speakers – A Good Surprise  
  
One thing I did like is the stereo speaker quality — it’s loud and clear, good for watching videos and music playback.  
  
---  
  
🔋 Battery – Decent  
  
Battery life is good thanks to the 6000mAh battery, but the heating issue slightly affects long usage comfort.  
  
---  
  
🔌 Accessories – Poor Quality Cable  
  
The USB-C data cable feels very cheap and low quality. It doesn’t match the phone’s price or branding. It feels like a fake or third-grade cable, which is disappointing from Samsung.  
  
---  
  
❌ Final Verdict (3/5)  
  
The Galaxy M35 offers a few good things like battery and speakers, but it’s far from a premium phone.  
You expect more at this price — like a better screen experience, stronger network performance, smoother usage, and quality accessories.  
  
If you're looking for natural whites on screen, consistent 5G signal, and a cool-running phone — you may want to look elsewhere

#####  _5.0 out of 5 stars_ Awesome phone and a balanced non chinese phone below 20000 ⟨125⟩
Reviewed in India on 19 July 2025
Colour: Moonlight Blue __Size: 8GB + 128GB⟨126⟩ __Verified Purchase⟨100⟩
Awesome phone with Awesome features, Awesome camera, Awesome one ui, Awesome display, Awesome sound, Awesome weight management.  
Ordered 8gb ram 128 gb storage variant.  
Overall balanced phone with all required features. And let me mention one point that everybody keeps on repeating that it's bulky.  
  
In reality it's not bulky at all. If you hold it in your hand you will not notice the bulk for sure. Don't listen to others who say it's bulky, even on youtube.  
Fun fact A35 also feels similar in hand- nearly same weight and holding both in different hands doesn't make any difference.
