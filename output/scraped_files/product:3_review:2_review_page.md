##### _4.0 out of 5 stars_ Tampered package but the box seemed fine ⟨105⟩
Reviewed in India on 28 June 2025
Colour: DayBreak Blue __Size: 8GB + 128GB⟨106⟩ __Verified Purchase⟨100⟩
The package came with a tear just big enough to pull out the box from within. I was suspicious but the seal on the box was intact and seemed untouched. So I accepted it.  
The phone functions smoothly and the colors are crisp. It feels bulky though. Battery easily lasts for a day on a single charge. I got it for mom so it seems pretty reliable for normal usage.

#####  _5.0 out of 5 stars_ So far so good ⟨108⟩
Reviewed in India on 27 July 2024
Colour: DayBreak Blue __Size: 8GB + 128GB⟨106⟩ __Verified Purchase⟨100⟩
Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.  
  
Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.  
  
Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.  
  
If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.  
  
I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.  
  
They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.  
  
Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.  
  
For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.

My mother found it a little heavy but once you keep using it you get used to it.  
Camera is great for the price, got this for 13.5k and the next day price shot up to 17k.  
  
If you’re thinking to buy this, go for it but I’d suggest to wait for m36.

Colour: Moonlight Blue __Size: 6GB + 128GB⟨112⟩ __Verified Purchase⟨100⟩
Trusting on the brand ,I bought it for my father definitely working fine , battery compared to its capacity has disappoint him a little bit . Charging speed is good not superfast like others but good enough , I think the phone is durable but use a case and screen protector, fingerprint sensor as it is side mounted is fast and functional and actually I like it better than optical one .
