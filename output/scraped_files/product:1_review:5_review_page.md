#####  _5.0 out of 5 stars_ Nice M36 ⟨98⟩
Reviewed in India on 14 July 2025
Colour: Orange Haze __Size: 8GB + 128GB⟨99⟩ __Verified Purchase⟨100⟩
Nice M36.  
Had only 6 or 8 gb ram with 128 gb storage options. Storage of 256 gb option expected.  
Option to add virtual ram up to 8 gb out of available storage space is a good one.  
Dedicated memory slot would have been an added advantage, only hybrid slot provided - hence can use only 1 Sim if u prefer to use memory card.  
Battery is 5000 mah, could have been 6000 mah in this budget.  
Overall M36 is a good buy considering it's features and 6 years of o/s and security upgrade promise given by Samsung.

Reviewed in India on 20 July 2025
Colour: Serene Green __Size: 6GB + 128GB⟨103⟩ __Verified Purchase⟨100⟩
Absolutely blown away by this phone! I've been using the Samsung Galaxy M36 5G in Serene Green for about a month now, and it has exceeded all my expectations. The 6GB RAM and 128GB storage combination provides seamless multitasking - I can switch between apps, stream videos, and game without any lag whatsoever.

Colour: Velvet Black __Size: 8GB + 128GB⟨107⟩ __Verified Purchase⟨100⟩
I have been using Samsung M series since 6 years now. All handset in my family are from M series only. This one I have bought for my Teenage son as his first mobile.  
  
On first sight phone looks great and features as expected.  
Battery should have been 6000 Mah as other M series phones.  
Camera Is good.  
All that fancy stuff AI etc is also good.  
  
Just a suggestion to Samsung, Please start including a plain silicon Case with newly launch phones as they are not vailable in Market atleast for 2 weeks.
