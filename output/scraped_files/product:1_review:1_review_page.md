 Excellent Performance and Value – A True Beast for Work and Play!  
  
I've been using the ASUS TUF A15 for a few weeks now, and I'm genuinely impressed. This machine delivers top-notch performance for both productivity and gaming.  
  
✅ Pros:  
  
Powerful Ryzen 7 7345HS handles multitasking effortlessly—coding, editing, and running VMs is smooth.  
  
16GB RAM ensures no lag even with multiple Chrome tabs, IDEs, and background apps running.  
  
GTX 2050 might be entry-level for gaming, but it handles games like Valorant, GTA V, and FIFA comfortably at medium-high settings.  
  
SSD boot and load speeds are blazing fast.  
  
Thermals are well-managed with the dual 83-blade fan system. Even after hours of gaming, it doesn’t feel overly hot.  
  
RGB keyboard looks premium and adds to the gaming aesthetic.  
  
Military-grade build quality gives a solid and rugged feel—feels very durable.  
  
🚫 Cons:  
  
Slight fan noise under load (expected in performance laptops).  
  
Display could’ve been brighter outdoors, but great indoors.  
  
A bit on the heavier side—not ideal for very frequent travelers.  
  
💬 Verdict:  
For the price, this laptop is an absolute powerhouse. Whether you're a gamer, a student, or a developer, the ASUS TUF A15 strikes a great balance between performance, build, and looks. Highly recommended if you're looking for a reliable machine that won’t break the bank!

The media could not be loaded. 
// this is after using for 9 months  
I used my system for coding and programming purposes not for gaming...  
  
My laptop battery run only for 90min . After this time u need a charging port. And if you want to use it for medium size gaming purpose then first you put machine in charging port and then Play.  
  
So main problem it battery has very short time duration. You can't work for 4 to 5 hrs without electricity.  
  
Overall it is a good machine ...for coding and programming purpose.  
  
// this is my first review  
Performance is good and easy to use and ,,it is capable to run medium size games ...  
  
I am using for it coding and programs purpose ...to u can easily do multi tabing without any lagging.  
  
Display quality is good and u can watch it at 178° also with clear vision.  
  
I used it for one month and I face one problem that is battery...  
  
Battery charging is very fast it allmost full within 50mins ....  
  
But it drains battery in 90min approx.  
  
So if you want to use it for 3 to 4 hrs battery back than it is not a good choice  
  
Or  
  
Use it with continuous on charging mode .  
  
Heating issues:-  
  
Laptop get heated if it doesn't get proper ventilation so use it on a laptop stand so that is remain cool and gives you smooth performance.

#####  _1.0 out of 5 stars_ Can you work without the internet or without a touchpad? ⟨109⟩
Reviewed in India on 12 July 2025
Colour: Black, R7 | RTX 3050⟨106⟩ __Verified Purchase⟨100⟩
This laptop comes with a high-end processor and powerful graphics: that’s clearly its main selling point.  
  
Now, I get it - high-performance machines can have trade-offs. The battery life isn’t great, and yes, it does get warm. I was prepared for that.  
  
But here’s what I wasn’t prepared for:  
  
1. Can you work without the internet?  
  
If not, think twice. The Wi-Fi connection is highly unreliable. It frequently disconnects, and at times, it won’t connect at all.  
  
This is an issue which is faced by almost all the TUF users across the internet.  
  
2. Can you work without a touchpad?  
  
If not, this might not be the right choice either. The touchpad occasionally stops responding, and it often takes three or four restarts to get it working again.  
  
There are countless people who are complaining about this.  
  
_______  
  
These are basic usability issues that seriously affect productivity - no matter how good the specs are.  
  
And Amazon won't give you a "refund" option for this purchase as well.  
  
Edit: Highly unreliable bluetooth connection. It's not just my experience. Explore the internet. You'll find numerous TUF users facing the same issue.

#####  _4.0 out of 5 stars_ Decent product ⟨116⟩

The laptop is okay, only the battery drains very fast, but it has fast charging as well. Whenever I attach the charger to the laptop the screen goes black but comes back within seconds and the same while removing the adaptor the screen goes black for a second then comes back.

#####  _5.0 out of 5 stars_ Incredible Performance in the Sub-60K Range! ⟨120⟩
Reviewed in India on 18 October 2024
Colour: Graphite Black, R7 | RTX 2050⟨99⟩ __Verified Purchase⟨100⟩
I recently purchased the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 (RTX 2050), and I must say, this laptop is phenomenal for under ₹60,000. It handles every graphics-intensive game effortlessly, making them feel like a breeze. Whether it’s AAA titles or resource-heavy tasks, this machine delivers outstanding performance.  
  
The Ryzen 7 7435HS processor paired with the RTX 2050 GPU ensures smooth gameplay, and I’ve been running everything at high settings without any noticeable lag. The Turbo Mode really brings out its power, making it a top choice for gaming enthusiasts on a budget.  
  
However, there are a couple of small issues that are common with gaming laptops, like heating during prolonged sessions and the battery life being on the shorter side when gaming. But this is expected given the power it packs. For everyday tasks or casual use, the battery holds up well enough.  
  
Overall, this laptop is a BEAST in every way. It offers exceptional value for money, and for anyone looking for great performance under 60K, this is hands down one of the best options out there.
