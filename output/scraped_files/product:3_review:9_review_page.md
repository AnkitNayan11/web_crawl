The product is good. After using it for 1 week, The only thing I didn't like is charging speed.  
Very slow charging. It takes around 2.5 hours for full charge.

Still on Android 14 need update as promised. The camera, display, and speaker are all good. Sure, some photos can look a bit off, but for the price, this phone is a solid choice.  
Flickering yes it's there occasionally you notice in low light, I stopped using in low brightness

#####  _4.0 out of 5 stars_ Samsung M35 phone review ⟨105⟩
Reviewed in India on 13 April 2025
Verified Purchase⟨100⟩
The Samsung Galaxy M35 5G is a solid mid-range phone, offering a vibrant 6.6" Super AMOLED 120Hz display and a massive 6,000mAh battery that easily lasts a full day. It runs on the Exynos 1380 chip with up to 8GB RAM, handling everyday tasks smoothly. The 50MP main camera performs well in daylight, though low-light shots could be better.  
  
Pros:  
  
Excellent battery life  
  
Smooth 120Hz AMOLED display  
  
Clean software with long-term update support  
  
Cons:  
  
Bulky and a bit heavy  
  
Slow 25W charging with no charger in the box  
  
Average low-light camera performance  
  
Overall, it's a great choice for users who value battery life and display quality over ultra-fast performance or camera versatility.

Colour: Thunder Grey __Size: 6GB + 128GB⟨123⟩ __Verified Purchase⟨100⟩
The phone is good for the price that I paid i.e.13499 .  
  
The good thing that I found about this phone is display is quite good and it is amoled as well as 120 hz, camera are quite impressive sound is good better backup is also good and the best part is the Samsung will give it 4 years of Android upgrade that is the best in the segment I am not concerned much about processor because I will handover this phone to my father so I think never gonna play any game in this phone and I think this processor is very much terrible for handling day to day task.  
  
Coming to the cons of this phone I think have to Samsung has to give much more options to customize because the One UI in this phone is very little customisable as compared to those of as 24 and also the charging speed is very very slow it took almost 2 hour with the Samsung original 25 watt charger. And also there is also one more calls that is the Samsung doesn't give a charger in the box so I have to purchase is separately and have to pay 1000 more to get the charger so I think Samsung should have to give it in the box

Overall Experience is good especially the os upgrade and one ui 7 I got just now in my phone but...  
The only problem is despite of monster battery i.e. 6k the output is not upto the mark and yes it drains not fast but it drains fast compare to my 3 old phone which has 5k.  
Once in a while the lag issue is there  
I am not photogenic so camera department please read other's review .  
User experience is too good so prize to output ratio is good if it is under 14k I got it under offer prize i.e. 13.5k  
Charging speed is very slow but I think it will somehow enhance the battery capacity so I don't mind.  
Dear Samsung we are middle class we can't afford the stringent norms of your sustainable environment as we are not exploiting we are doing our fundamental duties very well SO PLEASE PLEASE PROVIDE CHARGER .  
Connectivity is okok sometimes I Experience disconnections but it's subjective depends on availability of the network.  
Overall it can be nice product if you provide charger..

#####  _3.0 out of 5 stars_ Superfast Battery Drain ⟨127⟩
Reviewed in India on 13 June 2025
Colour: Moonlight Blue __Size: 8GB + 128GB⟨99⟩ __Verified Purchase⟨100⟩
Purchased on 7th June '25 for rs.18.5K & on 13th June price dropped to Rs.15K!! Feel conned :(  
Phone battery at 6000mah doesn't hold up even for a day. Battery drains out rather quick. Had to put most apps into deep sleep and stay away from the phone in order to keep the battery alive longer. Removed most of the preloaded bloatware and yet overnight 10% battery charge vanishes.  
Camera output is ok. Phone isn't really as heavy as mentioned in most reviews. It's bigger though.  
Wish I could return the phone & get a refund but product has a 7 days service center policy.  
Fingerprint sensor is smooth as of now.  
Phone looks good but unsure about durability.
