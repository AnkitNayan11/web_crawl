Good camera is the only good thing I can think about. Case is plastic make, light weight, phone hangs a lot even with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage. Can't play music loud, the phone vibrates. Could have provided a back cover with the phone which would be helpful, the one I ordered doesn't have the precision cuts for the buttons."

    "review": "Good phone overall for seventeen and a half thousand. Display three and a half out of five, not as vivid as my old Nokia with pure display and that one was an LCD. Speed and processor four out of five. Battery four out of five. Software three and a half out of five, too many unnecessary Samsung apps, bloatware, however the One UI depth is impressive and you get Samsung updates for many years. Design three and a half or maybe four out of five, plastic back, ordinary design. Camera four out of five. Price four out of five. Will I buy again? Yes. At this price range there may be better configurations, but Samsung has strong support and a mature ecosystem. I hope they reduce bloatware, they don't need it to sell their devices. A clean install with minimum Samsung apps will be so good."

    "review": "Honest raw review. The mobile is not worthy of the price though I bought 8GB RAM. The mobile processing and response is slow and the camera is not good for this price. Camera of mobile feels like less than 10k also the clarity of the screen is not that great. The signals and switching between wifi and mobile data is not proper. If you are expecting it to be very good I suggest not to go for it. You can buy it if you want to try all the latest AI features. Else if you are expecting a good camera and fast processing then go for a higher end mobile of 25k or more. The screen size is good and feels big which is good but the performance can be better. I used Samsung M33 which was very good but did not expect M36 like this."

    "review": "I purchased the Samsung M36 5G on 16 July 2025 from Amazon, and within just a few days, the display stopped working completely. I immediately reached out to Amazon for a replacement, but to my surprise, they refused to provide any support or replacement, even though the issue occurred well within the return period. I then visited the Samsung Service Centre, hoping for a resolution, but the experience was even worse. The staff was unhelpful, and no proper service or repair was provided. I have wasted hours with no result. I feel completely let down by both Samsung and Amazon. This was a high-value product, and I expected at least basic after-sales service. Unfortunately, this has turned into a frustrating and disappointing experience. I strongly advise others to think twice before buying this phone or trusting the service support from either Samsung or Amazon."

    "review": "Don't think too much. Except the missing part of punch hole, the phone is actually good. I got it at 16000 from Amazon. Considering the price point, it is awesome. I'll update after a few days of use. But I must say, the build quality is brilliant. It looks very premium and battery lasts pretty good. Out of the box it had 64 percent and after 5 to 6 hours of continual use, it is still standing strong at 14 percent. I think that's pretty handy. It will surely last a day. The camera quality is quite good also. As of now, I haven't seen any bad issue with it. Maybe not a huge upgrade from M35 physically but considering the software development, that's also a good point. It is very smooth and didn't experience any heating issue, except after that first boot, which is quite natural for any phone. Go for it. Don't worry."

    "review": "The mobile is good but the antenna is poor and there is a reason to say that. I was using Honor Y9 Prime 2019 and when I compare the Samsung Galaxy M36 5G to the Honor, the antenna power of Honor is much better as it used to pull 3G inside the house at least 1 bar and 2G. I thought buying this phone would improve the signal but to my surprise the new Samsung phone can't pull the 2G signal, let alone 3G, 4G, and don't dream about 5G. So if anyone is thinking to buy this phone for better signal power if facing network problem, don't buy as the technology has not improved from 2019 to 2025, it has become worse. So this mobile has become my computer as I can't call from the mobile. The company should improve their signal power. Hope they take a note of this."

    "review": "Ordered this for my mom. The usage is typically 1 to 2 hours of network or WhatsApp calls with family, involving voice and video calls per day. Maybe 1 to 2 hours of video content viewing over WiFi and data. Overall 5 hours of screen on time per day. The phone does get a bit hot after 1 hour of video calls which I guess is ok at this price point. I observed some app crashes like while making some UPI payments, when it tries to open camera module to scan QR codes, strange. However, it's less than a week of observations, probably some software updates could fix some issues. Hoping for the hardware to last 6 plus years like the software updates. Camera is decent. Sound over speaker is loud and gets the job done. Do not expect gaming. Battery life so far seems decent with the usage level, lasts a day with 5 to 6 hours screen on time with 30 to 40 percent left by end of the day. For the price you could get other options, but my need is for longer software updates and that's the only selling point. Otherwise a 3 to 4 star phone in terms of value for money."

If you use an SD card then only one SIM can be used since they provide only 2 slots and there is no separate slot for SD card. There is no charger included as well and no slot for headphone jack so you can only use wireless earphones and cannot use wired earphones."
