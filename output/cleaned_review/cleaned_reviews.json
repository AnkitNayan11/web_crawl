    "review": "After 6 months of using this phone, I think it is the best phone at this price. It performs smoothly without ever lagging, camera is great, battery is good, I only charge once every one and half day. Charging speed is pretty good too at 25 watt, it goes from 15 to 80 in about 40 minutes. Everyone says it has thick bezels which it has, but you get used to it in no time and you do not even feel they are there. Heating is no issue with this phone considering I do not use heavy apps, only day to day use. One thing I do not like about this phone is how heavy and big it is. I did not think that at first but after using, I think small and lighter phones would be easier to use and handle."

    "review": "The Samsung Galaxy M35 5G is a solid mid-range phone, offering a vibrant 6.6 inch Super AMOLED 120Hz display and a massive 6000mAh battery that easily lasts a full day. It runs on the Exynos 1380 chip with up to 8GB RAM, handling everyday tasks smoothly. The 50MP main camera performs well in daylight, though low-light shots could be better. Pros: Excellent battery life, smooth 120Hz AMOLED display, clean software with long-term update support. Cons: Bulky and a bit heavy, slow 25W charging with no charger in the box, average low-light camera performance. Overall, it is a great choice for users who value battery life and display quality over ultra-fast performance or camera versatility."

Other than that everything is nice and good. Awesome display. Good natural colour producing camera. Charging speed is also good for 6000mAh battery. If it supported 45W charger it would be better but for 15000 it is good to have 25W. 120Hz display is very smooth and optimized. Overall good. If your budget is tight go for it, otherwise wait until the price drops for A36, A56 or S24FE."

    "review": "The camera quality is good, capturing natural colors without the over-processing effects found in many Chinese phones. However, one thing that really disappointed me is the latency. I tap the shutter, and the picture gets clicked 2 to 3 seconds later. With a 6000mAh battery, the backup is impressive. But the charging speed is quite slow due to the included 25W support only. Do not expect fast top-ups. You can enjoy gaming for 4 to 5 hours without heating, which is great. But after that, especially in the summer, it does start getting noticeably warm. Nothing too fancy here. The UI is just like other Samsung phones, clean and simple, but not loaded with extra features. The phone is quite heavy, mainly due to the big battery. Watching movies or reels while lying down for long becomes uncomfortable. This part is really disappointing. You do not get a charger, back cover, or screen guard. Just a Type-C to Type-C cable and the phone. After around 5 months, the fingerprint sensor has started acting up occasionally, which can be annoying. Overall, it is a decent phone with a strong battery, good camera, and solid performance. But keep in mind the extra costs. A charger, back cover, and screen guard can add another 11000 to 12000 rupees to the total."

Its camera setup delivers better-than-average results in daylight, though it is not flagship-level. The phone feels bulky in hand, likely due to its large battery, but this also translates to decent battery life. Samsung’s One UI software continues to be smooth, feature-rich, and reliable, ensuring a good user experience overall. A solid choice for those prioritizing display, sound, and battery over sleek design."

The good thing that I found about this phone is the display is quite good and it is AMOLED as well as 120Hz, cameras are quite impressive, sound is good, battery backup is also good and the best part is that Samsung will give it 4 years of Android upgrade which is the best in the segment. I am not concerned much about processor because I will hand over this phone to my father so I think never going to play any game in this phone and I think this processor is very much suitable for handling day to day tasks. Coming to the cons of this phone, Samsung has to give much more options to customize because the One UI in this phone is very little customizable as compared to others and also the charging speed is very slow, it took almost 2 hours with the Samsung original 25 watt charger. Also, Samsung does not give a charger in the box so I had to purchase it separately and pay more to get the charger. Samsung should have given it in the box."

Once in a while the lag issue is there. I am not photogenic so for camera department please read others' reviews. User experience is too good so price to output ratio is good if it is under 14000, I got it under offer price. Charging speed is very slow but I think it will somehow enhance the battery capacity so I do not mind. Please provide charger. Connectivity is okay, sometimes I experience disconnections but it depends on availability of the network. Overall it can be a nice product if you provide charger."

Had to put most apps into deep sleep and stay away from the phone in order to keep the battery alive longer. Removed most of the preloaded bloatware and yet overnight 10 percent battery charge vanishes. Camera output is okay. Phone is not really as heavy as mentioned in most reviews. It is bigger though. Wish I could return the phone and get a refund but product has a 7 days service center policy. Fingerprint sensor is smooth as of now. Phone looks good but unsure about durability. Amazon customer service has advised a trip to the Samsung center to get the phone checked. Replacement depends on their evaluation."
