This laptop is excellent for its price. Other than the graphics card you can add the RAM and SSD capacity in the provided empty slots. I bought it for video editing and found it excellent for mid level use.

Recieved defective product. Screen not working.  
Edit:  
Contracted service centre, they said to press and hold power button for 20 second. After that screen is working.  
I am confused whether it is an issue or not!  
Edit after 10 days: display got failed and get replaced from the service centre.

Charging Issue and Screen Flickering in New Laptop – Needs Immediate Attention  
Review  
I recently purchased this laptop, and unfortunately, I'm facing an issue with the charging. Whenever I plug it in to charge, the screen starts blinking intermittently, and for a few seconds, it even goes completely black. This happens every time I plug it in, regardless of whether it's on battery or plugged into the charger.  
I have attached a video to showcase the problem for a clearer understanding. Despite the laptop being brand new, this issue seems to persist. I’ve tried reconnecting the charger, performing a power reset, and checking for any loose connections, but the problem still exists.  
Pros  
- The laptop is fast and smooth when it's working fine.  
- The design and build quality are great.  
  
**Cons**:  
- Screen flickering and blackouts during charging.  
- Battery charging seems inconsistent at times.  
  
I hope the manufacturer can look into this issue and provide a solution, as this is a significant concern with a new device.  
Bettery problem drain.

This laptop is worth for playing high level games, and it is super performing in coding, editing,etc...  
Sound quality are best, think about weight, but it has military grade, having 2050 rtx, not soo bad, if you are thinking for mostly to do more studies work, editing, and less games it may helpful.  
Heating may occur due to high end level games, make sure to buy any cooling pad, battery according to this laptop is good compared to other gaming laptop, due to its lower graphics card.  
Charing is must for a better gameplay, editing, or to perform well, and there is a "battery care mode" on Myasus app, for reducing heat as well as for best battery longetivity, make sure to on it. Appearance is nice for gamers and having aura blacklit sync!!  
This review may be helpful for you about this laptop, it is worth as it has ryzen 7 7000 series as other laptops have most cost than this!!  
Top notch  
5/5 stars!!!
